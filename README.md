🌐 Internship Task 2 - Grafana Cloud Monitoring Dashboard
🧩 Descripton
This project is part of my internship Task 2, where I set up a cloud-based monitoring dashboard using Grafana Cloud and Prometheus. The objective was to create a basic monitoring solution that visualizes key system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and network activity. I used Grafana's free cloud tier to build and configure the dashboard and added visualizations using example Prometheus metrics.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Grafana Cloud – Used to build and host the monitoring dashboard.
Prometheus – Used as a data source for example monitoring metrics.
GitHub – Repository for code, documentation, and screenshots.
🚀 Steps Followed
Created a Grafana Cloud account and configured a new cloud stack.
Set up Prometheus as a data source (using default example or demo metrics).
Built a new dashboard named System Monitoring Dashboard.
Created 4 panels, each representing:
CPU Usage
Memory Usage
Disk Space Usage
Network Usage
Saved and arranged the panels on the dashboard for better visual clarity.
Took screenshots of each panel for documentation.
Created a GitHub repository to host the README and screenshots.
(Optional) Attempted alert setup. Due to lack of live data, alerting was not configured.
🔔 Alert Configuration
Although Grafana supports advanced alerting, alerts were not configured in this project due to unavailable real-time data. However, the dashboard is prepared for future alert rule integration, such as:

Trigger alert if CPU usage > 80%
Trigger alert if disk usage > 90%
